I am writing this post mortem at 1:35pm on the day of the assignment due date.

That being said its not hard to guess that I proooobably procrastinated this assignment, 
and if you did guess that then congratulations! You win a crisp high five because you're
absolutely correct. The biggest trial I have faced is making this project over the past 
15 hours on one energy drink and fried chicken. Figuring out how to get the logic to work
was definately a big challenge especially given that I haven't really ever had a project
this involved before, and I didn't go into it with an idea of how to implement anything.
I trial-by-fired my way through the entire thing, trying different ways to get the ships
to place and detect if they were hit or not until something worked and I stuck with it.
This may lead to some quite gross code, however I was able to break lots of things down
into helper methods which is something I have never done for any project. My biggest 
improvement is going to be me making sure I start the next assignment sooner to have more
time to ask questions on it and get your advice on certain aspects of the code.

I spent approximately 18 hours on this assignment, the majority of which was the past 15 
hours lol.
